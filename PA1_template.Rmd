## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data<-read.csv("./activity.csv", na="NA")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data.summ <-summarise_each(group_by(data, date ), funs(sum))
#mean(data.summ$steps, na.rm = TRUE )

```
The mean total number of steps taken per day is: `r mean(data.summ$steps, na.rm = TRUE )`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
